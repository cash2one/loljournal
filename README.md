## What the hell is this?

Back in the days there was a website called elolog.net. On that website, you could (manually) add your games of League of Legends and some notes on the game. E.g. what went awesome and where can you improve?  
Sadly, that website went offline (mainly because it took too much time to maintain the website, add new champions, etc). All those things can now be automatically updated using Riot's awesome API. 

So basically, after you register and login, you can fetch your 10 most recently played games, add your notes and be ready for the next game.

## Where is the project going?

There are some clear steps to take in the near future. The main subjects of these steps are design, testing and safety.  
After these steps, we will look at feature requests, usability issues and bug fixes.

## How can I help?

At the moment I am looking for people who their CSS and people who know how to implement CouldFlare on a website. Please get in touch or create a pull request.
